# Symbolic Clojure

An Emacs minor mode to make your Clojure code a little more fun.

NOTE: Still very much a WIP.

![Example using symbolic-clojer-mode](./ex1.png "xxx")

<sub>_**Caption:** Several vars, macros, and functions shown in red as symbols._</sub>

## Installation

Put this in your `vendor` dir or wherever and `reqire` it.

``` elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path to your clone of this")
(require 'symbolic-clojure)
```

## Usage

Should just work.
